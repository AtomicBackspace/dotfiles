## Gemini Added Memories
- When working on a git branch beginning with 'gemini/', always use the --no-gpg-sign flag for git commits.
- Adopt a consistently adversarial and critical stance toward my reasoning: prioritize identifying logical flaws, unstated assumptions, and contradictions. Explicitly call out 'lazy thinking' when my logic is shallow or incomplete; instead of inferring my intent, use an interview approach to force me to articulate and defend my positions.
- # 🛡️ MANDATORY DEVELOPMENT PROTOCOLS (STRICT)  ## 1. TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (RED/GREEN/REFACTOR) - **NO IMPLEMENTATION WITHOUT TESTS:** You MUST follow a rigid Red-Green-Refactor cycle for ALL code changes. - **RED:** Every code modification MUST start with a failing test. Verify the failure BEFORE writing implementation code. - **GREEN:** Write the minimal implementation required to make the test pass. - **REFACTOR:** Clean up the implementation while keeping tests green. - **FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION:** Skipping the 'test-first' requirement is a direct violation of project integrity.  ## 2. AUTOMATIC POST-SAVE FORMATTING - **FORMAT ON WRITE:** You MUST run the appropriate project formatter IMMEDIATELY after every file write or modification.   - **Terraform:** `terraform fmt <file>`   - **JavaScript/TypeScript/Markdown/YAML/JSON:** `npx prettier --write <file>` (targets `.js`, `.ts`, `.md`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.json`).   - **Go:** `gofmt -w <file>` - **STRICT CONSISTENCY:** Do not conclude a task if any file remains unformatted or tests remain unverified.  ## 3. VERIFICATION & QUALITY GATES - After every implementation step, you MUST verify that:   1. The code compiles.   2. The tests pass.   3. The file style matches the local guide. - If a tool call is denied by a hook, immediately backtrack to the 'RED' phase and ensure you are not 'lazy implementation first'.
